/**
 * Instructions for manually fixing encoding issues:
 *
 * 1. Open the JSON file in a good editor like VS Code
 * 2. Ensure your editor is set to use UTF-8 encoding
 * 3. For VS Code:
 *    - Open the file
 *    - Click on the encoding indicator in the bottom right (usually says "UTF-8")
 *    - Select "Save with Encoding"
 *    - Choose "UTF-8" (not "UTF-8 with BOM")
 *    - Save the file
 *
 * If your files still have issues after saving with UTF-8 encoding:
 * 1. Make sure you're typing Chinese characters directly or copying from a reliable source
 * 2. Verify your font has Chinese character glyphs
 * 3. Check that your browser and editor have the proper language packs installed
